\begin_layout Enumerate
The definition of “
\series bold
\color brown
Bandwidth
\series default
\color inherit
” in the computing domain refers to the rate of data over time.
 Data is usually measured in bits,
 the time unit in seconds,
 and it’s often abbreviated as “bps”.
 This term is also used in lower-layer protocols,
 like the PHY layer in Wi-Fi,
 where bandwidth is measured in hertz (Hz),
 not in bps,
 but the wider the channel in Hz,
 the more bps can be transmitted.
 In Wi-Fi,
 it basically represents the channel width.
 Bandwidth refers to the maximum theoretical capacity of a channel to transmit data,
 it’s a property of the medium or communication channel,
 not the actual speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Throughput
\series default
\color inherit
,
 like bandwidth,
 also represents a rate of data over time,
 but unlike bandwidth where bps means the total theoretical capacity of the channel throughput measures the amount of bits delivered from source A to source B.
 In fact a data transmission can encounter different obstacles on the way,
 which can lead to packet loss or delays,
 that is why measuring throughput is critical in networking and signal processing.
 Data can be measured not only in bits,
 but also in packets or frames (blocks containing a fixed number of bits).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Packet loss
\series default
\color inherit
 could be represented by formula:
 
\color red
PLR = (1 - (received frames) / (total frames transmitted))
\color inherit
 this shows the ratio of lost packets to total sent packets.
 The higher the result of this formula,
 the worse the channel quality.
 
\color brown
Jitter
\color inherit
 is a complex measurement and it can be calculated in different ways.
 For example,
 there are Random Jitter (RJ),
 Deterministic Jitter (DJ),
 and Total Jitter (TJ).
 Basically,
 jitter shows the variation in the packet delivery time in other words,
 how much the interval between packet arrivals changes over time the higher is a jitter value the less stable and predictable is a signal.

 is an abbreviation for bits per second,
 while

\color inherit

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is bytes per second.
 
\color red
1 byte = 8 bits
\color inherit
.
 “Bps” is used in higher-layer protocols because data sizes are usually measured in bytes rather than bits.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is more useful in lower-layer protocols such as MAC or PHY.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Protocol payload
\color inherit
.

\series default
 Protocol in domain of computing is a set of rules which defines the way how to deliver and extract the message,
 without which it would be a random bit stream.
 
\color brown
Payload
\color inherit
 is an actual message,
 for which protocol is applied.
 
\series bold
\color brown
Message
\series default
\color inherit
 is a meaningful expression with well defined bounds (it has finite size) for example:

\color brown
Protocol payload
\color inherit
 is a message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Protocol overhead
\series default
\color inherit
 is the extra cost,
 which can be represented as time,
 extra bits,
 and processing logic needed for delivering data from source to destination.
 For example,
 some protocol header bits must be sent with a message (payload) to ensure that the receiver can extract the message.
 It also could be some logic like a handshake in TCP to establish a connection between RX (receiver) and TX (transmitter).
 In the end,
 all of these things are time-consuming,
 that’s why they are called overheads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
\color inherit
,

\series default
 defined in IEEE 802.1D,
 is used to prevent loops in switched networks.
 Switches communicate with each other by sending BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Units) every 2 seconds.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start,
 all switches consider themselves as the root bridge and send BPDU messages containing their Bridge ID to neighboring switches.
 Each switch compares its own Bridge ID with the neighbor’s and forwards the smallest one further.
 After several exchanges,
 all switches know the Root Bridge,
 the switch with the lowest Bridge ID.
 Next,
 each switch calculates the shortest path to the Root Bridge using the path cost defined in 802.1D.
 If a switch has multiple paths,
 the shortest one is kept as the designated port,
 and the longer path is blocked.
 As a result,
 STP creates a loop-free spanning tree,
 ensuring that packets can reach every LAN segment while avoiding broadcast storms.

\begin_layout Enumerate
A 
\series bold
\color brown
collision domain
\series default
\color inherit
 is a segment of a network space where a signal is traveling.
 To communicate,
 clients sometimes use the same route for example,
 the same frequency if we talk about Wi-Fi.
 When two clients try to send data at the same time on the same channel,
 their signals interfere and collide it will lead to packet loss.
 After a collision,
 the data must be retransmitted,
 which causes delays and reduces network performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A 
\series bold
\color brown
broadcast domain
\series default
\color inherit
 can be described as a segment of a network.If I send a frame on Layer 2 with the destination address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF,
 it means “send this to all members of my subnet where I am located.”If the router is configured to combine several physical subnets into one logical subnet,
 then all of them become part of the same broadcast domain,
 even if they are physically separated.However,
 the actual boundary of such a broadcast domain will always end at the router,
 which separates this domain from the rest of the internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
SOHO network 
\series default
\color inherit
(Small Office / Home Office) is not an official networking term,
 meaning it is not defined in any standards like IEEE 802.11.SOHO is used to describe a networking scenario,
 where several clients are connected through the same router or the same physical cable.In most cases,
 all clients are members of a single subnet,
 sharing the same LAN and belonging to the same broadcast domain.However,
 a SOHO network can also contain multiple broadcast domains —
 for example,
 one subnet can be used for guests,
 another for IoT devices,
 and another for regular users.This separation is usually done using VLANs configured on the same router.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
MAC (physical)
\series default
\color inherit
 address is a unique number that every device with a network interface has,
 for example Wi\SpecialChar nobreakdash
Fi or Ethernet.
 It is usually 48 bits and written as hexadecimal pairs,
 for example AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF.
 MAC addresses are used on the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) so that devices can find each other inside the same network.
 When one device sends a frame to another,
 it puts its own MAC as the source and the MAC of the receiver as the destination.
 Without MAC addresses,
 sending data would be a lot more complicated,
 because devices would have to “ask” everyone in the network if the packet is for them.With MAC,
 it’s much easier —
 switches and Wi\SpecialChar nobreakdash
Fi routers know exactly where to deliver the frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Physical layer protocol 
\series default
\color inherit
data unit (PDU) is a bit.
 Generally,
 the physical layer does not have any high-level logic except for math and physics,
 where bits are turned into signals.
 In Wi-Fi these are radio waves,
 in Ethernet they are electrical signals,
 and in optical fiber they are light flashes.
 The exact instructions on how to modulate the signal come from Layer 2.
 The physical layer is usually optimized more by mathematicians and physicists than by programmers,
 but it's best when all three skills are combined in one person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
MAC layer protocol data unit (PDU)
\series default
\color inherit
 is called a frame.
 Before sending data to the physical layer,
 L2 takes the IP packet from L3,
 adds the source and destination MAC addresses,
 and then the logic depends on the type of network.
 In modern Ethernet,
 which works in full-duplex,
 there’s no need for collision detection,
 so MAC mostly just adds the addresses and passes the frame down to the PHY layer.
 In Wi\SpecialChar nobreakdash
Fi,
 the MAC layer is a lot smarter:
 it has to analyze the channel,
 choose the right modulation for PHY,
 run algorithms to avoid collisions (CSMA/CA with random backoff),
 and only after all of this it sends the frame to L1 for transmission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Half-duplex vs Full-duplex
\series default
\color inherit
.
 Half-duplex means a device can either transmit or receive,
 but not at the same time.
 Full-duplex means sending and receiving simultaneously.In modern Ethernet full-duplex is implemented on the physical level:
 the cable has separate pairs of wires for transmitting and receiving,
 so data flows both ways at once without collisions.
 In Wi-Fi,
 on the other hand,
 communication is half-duplex.
 A station cannot transmit and receive at the same time because its own signal would interfere with the receiver.
 Wi-Fi uses channel access algorithms and sometimes separates uplink and downlink subcarriers,
 but simultaneous full-duplex transmission is generally not used in current standards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Ethernet auto-negotiation
\series default
\color inherit
 is a synchronization mechanism that allows two devices connected by an Ethernet cable automatically choose the best way to communicate.
 When devices are connected via cable,
 both start sending special signals called FLP (Fast Link Pulses),
 these signals contain information about what technologies each device has,
 like the supported speeds,
 duplex modes,
 and whether they support flow control.
 After exchanging this information,
 the devices compare their capabilities and pick the highest performance mode they both support.
 First,
 they choose the maximum possible speed,
 then they check the duplex mode:
 if both sides support full-duplex,
 they use it;
 otherwise,
 they fall back to half-duplex.
 Finally,
 they decide if flow control will be used which is a feature that helps to avoid packet loss when one side is slower than the other by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

holding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data transmission.
 If auto-negotiation is disabled on one device but enabled on the other,
 the devices may choose different duplex modes,
 which leads to collisions,
 retransmissions,
 and lower performance.
 That’s why in most modern networks,
 auto-negotiation is enabled on both ends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Hidden node problem
\series default
\color inherit
 (wireless) can occur when STAs (clients) are located far from each other but use the same AP (access point) between them.
 This is a MAC layer problem.
 In Wi\SpecialChar nobreakdash
Fi,
 all STAs share the same medium.
 When one STA sends data,
 it assumes the channel is free,
 but another STA may do the same,
 causing collisions and packet loss.
 To avoid this,
 the IEEE 802.11 standard includes the RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send) mechanism:
 the device first sends RTS to the AP,
 and if the AP replies with CTS,
 other devices stay silent during the transmission.
 RTS/CTS is not always enabled because it adds overhead and is usually used when many clients are connected to the same AP.

\begin_layout Enumerate

Networking physical vs logical topology.

\series default
\color inherit
 
\series bold
\color brown
Physical topology
\series default
\color inherit
 is based on real devices like routers,
 switches,
 and bridges (older tech),
 linked via radio channels or physical cables.
 A simple example is a PC or several PCs connected to a switch via cables,
 and the switch connected to a router.
 Physical topology is a core part of networking,
 like a skeleton.
 There are several common types of physical topology,
 and some of them are outdated today:
 Star,
 Mesh,
 Ring,
 and Bus.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Star topology is most common type today.
 Multiple devices are connected to the same central switch or hub.
 If one cable fails,
 the rest of the network keeps working.
 But if the central device fails,
 the entire network goes down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mesh topology is modern and very reliable.
 Each device connects to several others,
 so there are multiple paths for data.
 If one link fails,
 traffic can be rerouted automatically.
 Full mesh (each device connected to all others) is rare because it’s expensive,
 so partial mesh is used more often.
 This idea is also used in Wi-Fi mesh networks to cover a large area without dead zones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ring topology is when devices are connected in a circle,
 and data goes step by step through each node until it reaches the destination.
 Today,
 ring topologies are rare and mostly remain in some industrial or optical systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bus topology is one of the earliest types,
 where all devices share a single cable.
 Simple but depricated,
 replaced by switches and modern Ethernet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\color brown
Logical topology
\series default
\color inherit
 describes how data actually flows inside the network,
 regardless of how devices are physically connected.
 Even if multiple PCs are connected to the same physical switch (star topology),
 logically they can belong to different subnets or VLANs,
 which means they cannot communicate directly.

TIA/EIA-568 and ISO/IEC_11801.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\color brown
TIA/EIA-568
\series default
\color inherit
 is one of the main branches of the TIA standards,
 created by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA).
 It focuses on rules for structured cabling systems how to build Ethernet networks so that devices from different vendors work together.The standard defines cable categories like Cat5e,
 Cat6,
 Cat6a,
 and Cat8,
 each supporting different speeds and frequencies.
 It also describes how to wire and crimp RJ-45 connectors using two common schemes:
 T568A and T568B.
 Patch panels are also defined here,
 as well as maximum cable lengths and other installation rules.
 The main goal is to make sure network cables and equipment are compatible,
 reliable,
 and follow the same structured approach everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\color brown
ISO/IEC 11801
\series default
\color inherit
 is an international standard for structured cabling systems.
 It defines how to build universal cabling for offices,
 campuses,
 and other customer premises,
 so that different types of communication like Ethernet,
 telephony,
 and building control systems can work over the same infrastructure.This standard covers both twisted-pair copper cables and optical fiber.
 In many ways,
 it’s similar to TIA/EIA-568,
 but ISO/IEC 11801 is used globally,
 while TIA/EIA is mostly American.
 One important detail is that ISO includes Category 7 and 7a,
 but these are not recognized by TIA/EIA because there is no widespread hardware support for them.

Ethernet cabling categories.

\series default
\color inherit
 For example,
 CAT 6.
 Cat6 is one of the most common Ethernet cables used today 
\shape italic
and backward compatible with the Category 5/5e and Category 3 cable standards
\shape default
 (From wikipedia) .
 It supports 1 Gbps up to 100 m and can handle 10 Gbps up to around 55 m,
 with a frequency of 250 MHz.
 The cable is widely used in offices,
 homes,
 small server rooms,
 IP cameras and VoIP systems,
 because it’s reliable,
 not too expensive,
 and still compatible with older equipment.
 In practice,
 Cat6 is a good balance between cost and performance,
 which is why it became the standard choice for most installations.

8P8C (RJ-45)
\series default
\color inherit
 is the official name of the connector that people usually call RJ-45.
 The name means 8 Positions,
 8 Contacts,
 which describes the 8 pins inside the plug.
 This connector is used for Ethernet cables (Cat5e,
 Cat6,
 Cat6a,
 etc.) and lets devices like PCs,
 switches,
 and routers connect to each other.The term RJ-45 is technically not correct,
 because RJ-45 was originally a telephone standard,
 but in networking the name stuck and everyone uses it.
 In practice,
 when you say “RJ-45”,
 people understand it’s the standard Ethernet connector.

 each one improving speed,
 efficiency,
 and how many devices can work on the same network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) works mostly on 5 GHz,
 supports channel widths up to 160 MHz,
 and gives speeds up to several Gbps.
 Introduced MU-MIMO,
 which lets multiple devices receive data in parallel instead of waiting one by one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6 / 6E) works on 2.4 GHz,
 5 GHz,
 and even 6 GHz (Wi\SpecialChar nobreakdash
Fi 6E).
 Improves MU-MIMO and adds OFDMA,
 splitting the channel into smaller sub-channels so more devices can transmit at the same time.
 Better performance in crowded environments and lower latency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) the newest generation.
 Uses channels up to 320 MHz wide and supports Multi-Link Operation (MLO) a device can use multiple frequency bands simultaneously for higher speeds and better stability.
 It also improves MU-MIMO even further,
 supporting up to 16 spatial streams and allowing many clients to send and receive data at the same time.
 Theoretical speeds can go above 40 Gbps.
