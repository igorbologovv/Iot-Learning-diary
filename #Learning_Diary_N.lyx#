\begin_layout Enumerate
The definition of “
\series bold
\color brown
Bandwidth
\series default
\color inherit
” in the computing domain refers to the rate of data over time.
 Data is usually measured in bits,
 the time unit in seconds,
 and it’s often abbreviated as “bps”.
 This term is also used in lower-layer protocols,
 like the PHY layer in Wi-Fi,
 where bandwidth is measured in hertz (Hz),
 not in bps,
 but the wider the channel in Hz,
 the more bps can be transmitted.
 In Wi-Fi,
 it basically represents the channel width.
 Bandwidth refers to the maximum theoretical capacity of a channel to transmit data,
 it’s a property of the medium or communication channel,
 not the actual speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Throughput
\series default
\color inherit
,
 like bandwidth,
 also represents a rate of data over time,
 but unlike bandwidth where bps means the total theoretical capacity of the channel throughput measures the amount of bits delivered from source A to source B.
 In fact a data transmission can encounter different obstacles on the way,
 which can lead to packet loss or delays,
 that is why measuring throughput is critical in networking and signal processing.
 Data can be measured not only in bits,
 but also in packets or frames (blocks containing a fixed number of bits).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Packet loss
\series default
\color inherit
 could be represented by formula:
 
\color red
PLR = (1 - (received frames) / (total frames transmitted))
\color inherit
 this shows the ratio of lost packets to total sent packets.
 The higher the result of this formula,
 the worse the channel quality.
 
\color brown
Jitter
\color inherit
 is a complex measurement and it can be calculated in different ways.
 For example,
 there are Random Jitter (RJ),
 Deterministic Jitter (DJ),
 and Total Jitter (TJ).
 Basically,
 jitter shows the variation in the packet delivery time in other words,
 how much the interval between packet arrivals changes over time the higher is a jitter value the less stable and predictable is a signal.

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\color brown
bps
\series default
\color inherit

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an abbreviation for bits per second,
 while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\color brown
Bps
\color inherit

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is bytes per second.
 
\color red
1 byte = 8 bits
\color inherit
.
 “Bps” is used in higher-layer protocols because data sizes are usually measured in bytes rather than bits.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is more useful in lower-layer protocols such as MAC or PHY.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Protocol payload
\color inherit
.

\series default
 Protocol in domain of computing is a set of rules which defines the way how to deliver and extract the message,
 without which it would be a random bit stream.
 
\color brown
Payload
\color inherit
 is an actual message,
 for which protocol is applied.
 
\series bold
\color brown
Message
\series default
\color inherit
 is a meaningful expression with well defined bounds (it has finite size) for example:
 
\family typewriter
\color darkgray

\family default
\color inherit
.
 
\color brown
Protocol payload
\color inherit
 is a message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Protocol overhead
\series default
\color inherit
 is the extra cost,
 which can be represented as time,
 extra bits,
 and processing logic needed for delivering data from source to destination.
 For example,
 some protocol header bits must be sent with a message (payload) to ensure that the receiver can extract the message.
 It also could be some logic like a handshake in TCP to establish a connection between RX (receiver) and TX (transmitter).
 In the end,
 all of these things are time-consuming,
 that’s why they are called overheads.
